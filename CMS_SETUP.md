# Content Management System Setup ✨

Your site now has a JSON-based content management system with Tina CMS integration ready to go!

## 🎯 What's Been Set Up

### 1. Content Structure ✅
All your site content is now stored in JSON files in the `/content` directory:
- `content/music.json` - Track listings and music page content
- `content/shows.json` - Upcoming/past shows and venue information
- `content/about.json` - Band member profiles, philosophy, and timeline
- `content/site.json` - General site settings, navigation, and footer

### 2. Tina CMS Integration ✅
- Updated React to version 18.3.1+ (compatible with Tina CMS)
- Tina CMS configuration ready in `tina/config.ts`
- Visual editing interface will be available at `/admin` once configured
- Build system supports both regular builds and Tina builds

### 3. Build Configuration ✅
- **Regular build**: `npm run build` (works without Tina credentials)
- **Tina-enabled build**: `npm run build:tina` (requires Tina credentials)
- **Development**: `npm run dev` (with Tina admin interface)

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Sign up for Tina CMS (Free)
1. Go to [tina.io](https://tina.io) and create a free account
2. Create a new project and select "GitHub" as your git provider
3. Connect it to your GitHub repository (`nathanjeichert/my-site`)
4. Choose the `main` branch

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
After creating your Tina project, you'll get:
- **Client ID** (starts with a random string)
- **Read-only token** for builds

Update your `.env.local` file with the actual values:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_from_tina
TINA_TOKEN=your_actual_token_from_tina
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel ✅
The site builds successfully on Vercel! To enable the CMS:
1. Add the environment variables to your Vercel project settings:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add both `NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID` and `TINA_TOKEN`
2. Redeploy your site
3. Your CMS will be available at `yourdomain.com/admin`

## 📝 How to Edit Content

### Option 1: Visual Editor (Recommended)
1. Visit `yourdomain.com/admin`
2. Log in with your Tina account

### Option 2: Direct File Editing
You can also edit the JSON files directly in your GitHub repository:
