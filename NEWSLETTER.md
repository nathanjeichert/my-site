# Show-Alert Newsletter

How the automatic gig-alert emails work. **Status: live and verified** (set up
June 16, 2026 — domain verified, a test broadcast landed in the inbox). Day to day
it needs nothing from you; the reference below is for if something ever breaks.

## Architecture (all free, no database)

- **Subscribers** live in a [Resend](https://resend.com) Audience. The old Redis
  database is gone (deleted by Redis Cloud for inactivity, Nov 2025) and nothing
  like it exists anymore — Resend's free tier has no inactivity expiration.
- **Signups**: the site form POSTs to `/api/subscribe`, which adds the contact to
  the Resend audience. Re-subscribing after an unsubscribe re-opts the contact in.
- **Alerts**: a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/announce-shows.yml`) runs on every
  push that touches `content/shows.json`. It diffs the file against the previous
  commit and, only when genuinely **new, upcoming** shows were added, sends **one
  digest email** via a Resend Broadcast. Edits to existing shows (times, typos,
  descriptions) never email anyone. Past-dated shows never email anyone.
- **Unsubscribes**: every email carries Resend's one-click unsubscribe link.
  Resend suppresses unsubscribed contacts from future broadcasts automatically.
  Nothing to manage.

Normal operation is fully hands-off: add a show to `content/shows.json` (locally or
via the GitHub web editor), push, and subscribers get one tasteful email. Vercel
redeploys the site from the same push.

Free-tier limits (plenty for now): 3,000 emails/month, 100/day, 1,000 contacts.

## How it was set up (already done — for reference)

1. **Resend account**: signed in with Google as nathanjeichert@gmail.com.
2. **Sending domain** `northerndisconnection.com` (region us-east-1) verified with
   three DNS records at **Namecheap → Advanced DNS**:
   - `resend._domainkey` **TXT** (DKIM) — in Host Records
   - `send` **TXT** (`v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`) — in Host Records
   - `send` **MX** (`feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com`, priority 10) — added
     via **Mail Settings → Custom MX**

   **Trade-off we accepted:** Namecheap only allows MX records in "Custom MX" mode,
   which disables its Email Forwarding. We had no inbound `@northerndisconnection.com`
   address in use, so forwarding was turned off. Replies still reach you because every
   email sets `Reply-To: nathanjeichert@gmail.com` (see `REPLY_TO` in the script). If
   you ever want inbound `@northerndisconnection.com` mail back, the clean path is to
   move DNS to Cloudflare (free Email Routing + free DNS, and it allows the `send` MX
   alongside forwarding).

   **Verification gotcha (if you ever re-verify a domain):** don't spam the "Verify"
   button. Each click restarts SES's MAIL-FROM detection; clicking every few minutes
   can reset it before it finishes. Add the records, click Verify once, then wait
   ~10–15 min untouched.
3. **Audience**: Resend's default "General" audience.
4. **Secrets wired** — `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID` in both Vercel (all
   environments, powers the signup form) and GitHub Actions secrets (powers the
   alert emails). To rotate the key later:

   ```sh
   # Vercel (powers the signup form) — repeat per environment
   npx vercel env rm RESEND_API_KEY production; npx vercel env add RESEND_API_KEY production
   npx vercel redeploy --prod   # or just push any commit

   # GitHub (powers the alert emails)
   gh secret set RESEND_API_KEY --repo nathanjeichert/my-site
   ```

## Testing / operations

- **Dry-run the alert email locally** (renders HTML, sends nothing):

  ```sh
  BEFORE_FILE=old-shows.json AFTER_FILE=content/shows.json DRY_RUN=1 node scripts/announce-shows.mjs
  ```

- **Dry-run in GitHub**: Actions → "Announce new shows" → Run workflow (dry-run
  defaults to on; it previews what the latest shows.json change would have sent).
- **Send a real test broadcast** (goes to everyone in the audience — currently just
  you): make a `before-real.json` copy of `content/shows.json` with one upcoming show
  removed, then:

  ```sh
  RESEND_API_KEY=… RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=… BEFORE_FILE=before-real.json AFTER_FILE=content/shows.json node scripts/announce-shows.mjs
  ```

- The Action is a graceful no-op (green, with a log message) if the secrets are ever
  missing, so pushes are never blocked by the newsletter.
- Sender address: `shows@northerndisconnection.com`, replies go to
  nathanjeichert@gmail.com.
- Resend dashboard: <https://resend.com> → Broadcasts / Audiences / Logs to see
  what was sent, manage contacts, and view delivery stats.
